<h1 align=center>Hard Work Vs Smart Work</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
   Working towards <mark><b>success</b></mark> needs a lot of planning before executing. 
   Deciding on the right way to perform a task is inevitable. <u><i>Smart Workers</i></u> are people 
   who use the right strategy to reach the end point easily. <u><em>Hard workers</em></u> are people
   who get noticed by everyone. In reality, both Smart Work and Hard Work are important
   to gain popularity in any field. Any person who has proven to be smart would have 
   started his or her career / performed in examinations because of Hard work in the 
   beginning. Hard Work, in fact, gives people more <u>sense of curiosity to taste victory</u>.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px"><mark><big>Smart Work</big></mark> helps a person <u>complete a task efficiently</u> – more work in less hours with 
   less resources and reduced efforts. Hard Work, also, helps a person to complete a task
   successfully – but <i><u>time consumption</u></i> will be more and there is no assurance if the task
   can be completed with <u>less resources</u>. The person who does hard work has to put a lot of efforts
   to complete a task.In short, with <strong><mark>Hard Work</mark></strong> we can complete a task successfully; but in order to
   gain fame among people and get recognition Smart Work matters a lot. Smart Workers prioritize
   their tasks, complete the most important ones first and the rest later. This makes their job
   easy since they can act towards a solution depending on the <i>priority</i>. </p>
